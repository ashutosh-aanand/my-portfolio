                <section id="about">
                    <p class="mb-4">With over two years of experience as a backend software engineer, I focus on understanding and refining product requirements to ensure that each solution is both practical and valuable. Collaborating closely with teams, I work to bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation, making sure every project has a solid foundation.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">I specialize in building backend systems that are designed for scalability, reliability, and speed. I prioritize performance and resilience, developing systems that can handle heavy loads and scale smoothly as user demand grows. Crafting these solutions requires a mix of creativity and technical rigor, which I bring to every project I work on.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">I work with a variety of tools and technologies, including Kafka, Cassandra, MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. These tools help me build robust and adaptable systems that can meet diverse needs across different environments. Iâ€™m constantly learning and experimenting with new tools to improve the efficiency and adaptability of my solutions.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time on competitive programming to sharpen my skills. I also love watching anime, working out, and helping out with household tasks. Staying active and engaged in my interests outside of work helps me return to my projects with a fresh perspective and renewed focus.</p>
